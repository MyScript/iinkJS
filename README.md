## Requirements

1. Have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
2. Have a MyScript developer account. You can create one [here](https://developer.myscript.com/support/account/registering-myscript-cloud/).
3. Get your keys and the free monthly quota to access MyScript Cloud at [developer.myscript.com](https://developer.myscript.com/getting-started/web)

## Installation

iinkJS can be installed with the well known package managers `npm`, `yarn`. 

If you want to use `npm` or `yarn` you first have to init a project (or use an existing one). 

```shell
npm init
OR
yarn init 
```

You can then install iinkJS and use it as showed in the [Usage](https://github.com/MyScript/iinkJS#usage) section.

```shell
npm install iink-js
OR
yarn add iink-js
```

## Usage

1. Create an `index.html` file in the same directory.

2. Add the following lines in the `head` section of your file to use iinkJS and the css. We use [PEP](https://github.com/jquery/PEP) to ensure better browsers compatibilities. Note that you can also use it using dependencies from `node_modules`:
```html
<script src="node_modules/iink-js/dist/iink.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/pep/0.4.3/pep.js"></script>
```

3. Still in the `head` section, add a `style` and specify the height and the width of your editor:
```html
<style>
    #editor {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
    }
</style>
```

4. In the `body` tag, create a `div` tag that will contain the editing area:
```html
    <div id="editor"></div>
```

5. In JavaScript and within a `<script>` tag placed before the closing tag `</body>`, create the editor using the `register` function, your editor html element and a simple configuration:
```javascript
  const editorElement = document.getElementById('editor');

  iink.register(editorElement, {
    recognitionParams: {
      type: 'TEXT',
      server: {
        applicationKey: '#YOUR MYSCRIPT DEVELOPER APPLICATION KEY#',
        hmacKey: '#YOUR MYSCRIPT DEVELOPER HMAC KEY#'
      }
    }
  });
```

6. Your `index.html` file should look like this:
```html
<html>
    <head>
        <script src="node_modules/iink-js/dist/iink.min.js"></script>
        <script src="https://code.jquery.com/pep/0.4.3/pep.js"></script>
        <style>
            #editor {
                width: 100%;
                height: 100%;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="editor" touch-action="none"></div>
    <script>
        const editorElement = document.getElementById('editor');

        iink.register(editorElement, {
            recognitionParams: {
                type: 'TEXT',
                server: {
                    applicationKey: '#YOUR MYSCRIPT DEVELOPER APPLICATION KEY#',
                    hmacKey: '#YOUR MYSCRIPT DEVELOPER HMAC KEY#'
                }
            }
        });
    </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

7. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve your folder content using any web server.
